Data: The data is an extract from the MODUL Studies of Living Conditions (Ponocny et al., 2015, 2016) and must not be used for any other purpose (except with the authors' permission) than (1) tracking and reproducing the results in this tutorial, and (2) teaching and demonstrating interim analyses.

R Code: The applied R code is available as an R script file with the real-world data set on GitHub: https://github.com/StatisticalPsychology/GSD. Furthermore, we briefly annotated this code for didactic reasons so it can be easily applied with R Studio (RStudio Team, 2019) in psychological research.
